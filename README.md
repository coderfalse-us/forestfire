# Picker Order Optimization System

## Overview

This project provides an implementation of a picker order optimization system to efficiently address the **Warehouse Picker Routing Problem**. It uses a combination of **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** and **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** to assign items to pickers while ensuring optimized paths.

The designed system minimizes total distance traveled by pickers in a warehouse by selecting the best assignments of items to pickers, incorporating picker capacities, and producing warehouse routes in a structured and logical manner. 

## Objectives

1. **Minimize Total Distance Traveled:** Optimize picker paths to reduce cumulative picking distance and save time.
2. **Ensure Picker Capacity Constraints:** Manage picker assignments, ensuring their capacity isn't exceeded.
3. **Route Optimization:** Address the layout design of a warehouse with walkways and cross-segments.
4. **Simulate & Visualize:** Visualize picker assignments and paths for better insights.

## Features

- **Picker Assignment:** Assigns items to warehouse pickers.
- **Fitness Function:** Evaluates picker assignments by computing total distances traveled, considering warehouse constraints.
- **Path Optimization:** Sorts picker paths to minimize unnecessary travel.
- **Genetic Algorithm:** 
  - Crossover and mutation operators to evolve solutions over iterations.
  - Capacity-based picker constraints in mutation and crossover.
  - Tournament selection for selecting parents.
- **Ant Colony Optimization:** Assigns items intelligently by considering heuristic and pheromone values.
- **Database Querying:** Extract warehouse data such as tasks, items, and staging areas from PostgreSQL tables.
- **Visualization:** Visualize picker paths and assignments in graphs using `matplotlib`.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Install required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Required libraries:
   - `random`: To generate random initial populations and item assignments.
   - `math`: For mathematical calculations like Euclidean distance.
   - `numpy`: To handle arrays and perform calculations efficiently.
   - `scipy`: To compute spatial distances.
   - `matplotlib`: To visualize picker assignments and routing paths.
   - `psycopg2`: For extracting pick tasks and item details from PostgreSQL.

3. **Database configuration**:  
   Update the PostgreSQL connection details in `db_c()`:
   ```python
   DB_HOST = "<your-db-host>"
   DB_NAME = "<your-db-name>"
   DB_USER = "<your-db-user>"
   DB_PASSWORD = "<your-db-password>"
   DB_PORT = "<your-db-port>"
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Warehouse Data Inputs**:
   - Picker locations, item locations, and item picking tasks are fetched through `db_c()`.
   - Details are stored in the form of dictionaries/lists.

2. **Model Configuration**:
   - Parameters such as number of pickers, picker capacities, warehouse layout (walkways), and optimization algorithm hyperparameters are defined.

3. **Fitness Evaluation**:
   - Calculates the Euclidean distances between picker locations and assigned items.
   - Ensures picker paths optimize their distance by following walkways/cross-segments.

4. **Optimization Process**:
   - **Initial Solution**:
     - Random initial population of picker-to-item assignments.
     - Evaluate each solution's fitness by calculating total traveled distances.
   - **Ant Colony Optimization**:
     - Compute heuristic (inverse distance) and pheromone values for each item.
     - Build an initial solution guided by these parameters.
   - **Genetic Algorithm**:
     - Evolve the solution over a number of iterations:
       - **Tournament Selection**: Select top individuals from the population.
       - **Crossover**: Combine parent solutions (single-point & uniform).
       - **Mutation**: Alter solutions to maintain diversity while enforcing capacity constraints.
   - **Best Solution**: Retrieve and plot the best picker assignments.
