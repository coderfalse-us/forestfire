# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Tests for ForestFire

This directory contains BDD feature files that describe the behavior of the ForestFire warehouse order picking optimization system in a human-readable format.

## Overview

BDD is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders. It focuses on defining the behavior of the system in a way that all stakeholders can understand.

## Feature Files

Feature files use the Gherkin syntax with the following structure:

- **Feature**: A description of the functionality being tested
- **Scenario**: A specific test case within the feature
- **Given/When/Then**: Steps that define the test case
  - **Given**: Sets up the initial context
  - **When**: Describes the action being taken
  - **Then**: Describes the expected outcome

## Running the Tests

The BDD tests are implemented using pytest in the `test_integration_bdd.py` file. To run these tests:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_integration_bdd.py -v
```

For more detailed output:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_integration_bdd.py -v --no-header --no-summary
```

## Adding New Scenarios

To add new scenarios:

1. Add the scenario to the appropriate feature file using Gherkin syntax
2. Implement the corresponding test in `test_integration_bdd.py`

## Benefits of BDD

- **Improved Communication**: BDD bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members
- **Living Documentation**: Feature files serve as up-to-date documentation
- **Focus on Business Value**: Tests are written from the user's perspective
- **Reduced Rework**: Clear specifications lead to fewer misunderstandings
